    "As we have seen earlier, the Hamming Weight of the result of the SBox operation in AES has a measurable effect on the power consumed by the microcontroller. It turns out that just this effect (and not anything stronger, such as its linearity) is enough information to break an AES key. There's a few different ways we could go about this, but for this tutorial, we'll be looking at difference of means. With this technique, the goal is to separate the traces by one or several bit(s) in the result of the SBox output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering one bit, the group of traces for which its value is 1 should, on average, have higher power consumption during the SBox operation than the other set in which its value is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-bit DPA, one must find a way to combine the values of the different bits to make two relevant groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not we get a large difference in the means between these two groups depends on whether they were properly sorted into these groups. If not, there should be, on average, little difference between the two and therefore a low difference of means. Recall the SBox operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://wiki.newae.com/images/7/71/Sbox_cpa_detail.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBox output depends on the subkey, which we don't know (and the plaintext, which we do). However, since there's a large difference of means for the correct key and small ones for the rest of the possible subkeys, we have a method of checking whether a given subkey is correct. If we calculate the difference of means for each subkey, the correct one will have the largest difference of means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the attack consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Capture power traces with varying plaintext (and fixed key !)\n",
    "1. Group each trace by the value of their SBox output's for a given subkey guess\n",
    "1. Calculate the difference of means (this is a trace)\n",
    "1. Repeat for each possible subkey\n",
    "1. Select the largest difference of means -> this should be the correct subkey\n",
    "1. Repeat for each subkey in the key\n",
