In order to generate the raw files required for the programs, please use "cpa/TME_4_Correlation_Power_Analysis_Attack.ipynb". The sixth and seventh blocks of code respetively capture data and save it on files you can download from the "traces" folder. 
You can define the number of traces and the number of samples in the sixth block. The default values are : 
DPA : 
	N = 5000
	samples = 3000
CPA : 
	N = 1000
	samples = 3000

To test with different values of these parameters, please update their values in "dpa/dpa.h" and "cpa/cpa.h".
